"""
LEGACY SCRIPT —
================================

This package contains legacy Python scripts preserved for historical
and backward-compatibility reasons. These files represent old data
reduction workflows or prototypes that were once part of the MATISSE
pipeline but are no longer maintained or used in production.

They are **excluded from all linters, formatters, and pre-commit hooks**
(e.g., Ruff, Black, isort) to avoid unnecessary modifications or style
updates. The code is kept exactly as-is to ensure reproducibility with
older data processing configurations.

⚠️ If you are developing new features or modern data reduction tools,
use the refactored implementation in `matisse_pipeline.core` or
`matisse_pipeline.cli` instead.
